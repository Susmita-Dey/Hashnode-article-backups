## Rise of Sukoon
It was our first hackathon and we were the beginner's team. When we all were figuring out what to make, the idea of making a stress-relieving website came to my mind. The reason behind making it was one simple situation. I was having a lot of stress during the pre-hackathon. To lessen it, I listened to music, watched some funny videos, and read some books and jokes. Then, I thought people often have stress in their daily lives. So, why can't we make a beautiful website to reduce people's stress by having such content which I used to reduce stress in one single website?

I discussed this with my teammates and they agreed and we started building it with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## Making of Sukoon
We divided our work among ourselves and start building different parts of the web page. First, we made the hero section and it wasn't looking so good as you can see below.

Then we thought of making a UI design for our website using [**Figma**](https://www.figma.com/).
I made a rough design using Figma which you can see below.

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FszHsU8Xgra9jFsohALYAXi%2FSukoon%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We then started coding to make a website similar to the design. Finally, we came to the conclusion and as time was running for the hackathon we couldn't make all of our services pages. But we promised ourselves to complete it soon. For now, some of our services pages are completed and one can use them to relieve stress.

You can use our website and get some motivation or reduce your stress by using our services present on the [website](https://sukoon-stress-free.netlify.app/).

## Conclusion
If you're learning web development, make sure to participate in hackathons and build new projects and solve real-life problems. If you don't wanna participate in hackathons, then you must make some unique projects on your own as this will enhance your learning and you'll also get to know where are you lacking behind or your knowledge is not strong in that particular area.

# Getting Started With React.js

## Introduction to React
React is a JavaScript-based library used for making static **Single Page Web Applications**. This was developed by Facebook. This helps in breaking down complex UI into simpler components. ReactJS has a high market in the field of Web development and it's increasing every day.

ReactJS is often compared with Angular, Vue, and other JavaScript libraries and frameworks. People often call it a framework of JavaScript when compared with Angular as Angular is a JavaScript framework, but it's eventually a library and not a framework.

> If you don't know the difference between a framework and a library, then check out this [article](https://susmitadey.hashnode.dev/difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library).

## Tools needed before installing ReactJS üõ†
You need to have the following things installed before you start creating a React Application.
1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Download the latest version of NodeJS
2. A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. A Chrome extension - [React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

I recommend you to be in Chrome while you're working with React for better experiences.

## Do you need to learn JavaScript before React? ü§î
If you're new to web development and haven't learned JavaScript but you're thinking to come out of the hell from working with HTML CSS on multiple pages for a single website by switching to ReactJS, then wait a while. If you want to do so, then you can do it but you'll face many problems if you don't know anything about JavaScript and finally give up with React being depressed.

So, I'll always recommend you to learn some basics of JavaScript and then jump over to ReactJS. Also, you should know that React is made on top of JavaScript.

## Creating Our First React App üë©‚Äçüíª
Let's create a React app using the following steps:
- Open up a folder in your terminal.
- Type `npx create-react-app my-app` in your terminal and hit Enter. This will take some time to install React and some other packages and dependencies to make your app ready.

- Go inside the folder by typing `cd my-app` in your terminal.
- Now use `npm start` in your terminal to see your app running locally at **http://localhost:3000/**
You'll see the following image when your app runs locally on your computer.

## Understanding the file structure üìÇ
You might get scared of watching the huge codebase i.e., the files and folders after you have created your React app. Some people might run like this shutting down their computers.

But no need to worry because I'm here to help you. Open up the folder called **my-app** in Visual Studio Code. You'll see the folders somewhat like this.

Now, here forget about the *node modules* folder as it only contains the packages and dependencies needed to make our ReactJS application. It got installed when we run our first command `npx create-react-app my-app`. So, we'll not be dealing with that folder, just keep it as it is.

Then comes the *public* folder. It contains some images and other files along with the `index.html`. Now here we only have to focus on our `index.html` file and others are not needed currently. The `index.html` file will contain the following:
```html
<div id="root"></div>
```
Here the root is used in `index.js` file which is inside the *src* folder to render the pages locally on localhost.

‚ö†One important thing is that do not keep any secrets or credentials inside this folder as it will be leaked since it's a public folder.

Next comes the `src` folder. It contains various javascript and CSS files. Heading over to the `index.js` file you can see the way they're creating ReactDOM and elements and rendering web pages. Then there are 2 stylesheets - `index.css` and `App.css` which are used for styling the pages. The main styling lies under `App.css` for which you can visualize the beautiful web page running locally on your localhost. Now, let's see the `App.js` file where we'll be working and writing our code to make our own websites. You'll find some HTML and javascript together in this file. You might get confused by this, but don't be because this is known as **JSX**.

## Understanding JSX üîé
JSX stands for **Javascript XML**. It is the syntax extension of Javascript which allows HTML to co-exist with Javascript in React. This feature ensures that all the code remains unified to supply the developer with the best possible experience. It also confirms that all files aren‚Äôt spread at various locations.

JSX in simple terms is like HTML wearing the crown of JavaScript. Let's see the `App.js` file inside the **src** folder. It looks like this:

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1655707631168/8TbvgGrg6.png align="left")

The highlighted part is known as JSX.

### Points to remember while using JSX:
- You have to write "className" instead of "class" as class is the reserved keyword in Javascript
- In place of "for" you have to use "htmlFor" 
- JSX fragment feature:
With return() we can return only one tag or Element. If you want to return two elements using JSX, then you have to use the JSX Fragment Feature or cover the whole content inside one element. ***For example***, if we want to return the content of an H1 tag and Div tag together we will be using a JSX fragment ( <>.....</>).

**Code:**

# Getting Started With C Programming Language

## What is C?
C is a general-purpose, procedural, middle-level programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system.

## Where C is used?
C programming language is used in the following areas:-
1. Operating System Design,
2. Compiler Design,
3. Text Editors,
4. Handling Database,
6. Interpreter, and many more.

## Why learn C?
1. Easy to learn
2. It is well structured.
3. It's syntax is similar to Java(if you're a Java programmer, then you'll understand).
4. It can handle low-level activities.

**Today we're gonna learn how to print hello world using C.**

## Source Code:-

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello World");
    return 0;
}
```
## Output:-
```
Hello World
```
So, this was pretty cool and simple.

## 5 most important tips every programmer should know to increase their coding skills

**These are as follows:-** 

1) You must **_code everyday even for 5-10 minutes_** to be consistent and build up your coding habit.

2) Take the ***learning in public initiative***. In order to do that you must be active in the community(social media) like **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/)** or **[Showwcase](https://www.showwcase.com/)** or **[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/)** for _atleast 10-20 minutes everyday_ and post what you've learned today or show your work and learn from the threads or posts of various people. 
I'm mentioning _Twitter_ because I myself have personally learnt many things from Twitter everyday based on topics like web development and open source. So, I would advise you to create a Twitter account and connect with people of your interest. 

3) You should use **[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)** for your doubts/problems whenever you stuck at any pace while coding. You may also join a [Discord community](https://discord.gg/g7FmxB9uZp) and ask your doubts to help you.

4) Build small small projects every week and upload the source code to **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** because the more you build; the more you get stuck at problems and the more you learn. I believe that it's always better to do things practically than just only knowing it theoretically.

5) Most important one - learn how to **Google** and solve your problems by your own.

More or less I hope that you all have heard about trending videos, movies or blogs. In the world of technology, there's a trend in programming languages, applications, technology innovation, design and much more. The word "trending" has been around for years, but its meaning shifts as old things are replaced with new ones. We all love to go with the trend and adopt them in our lives.

## Hashnode

Hashnode is the favorite platform for all technical writers and developers. This is a free blogging platform where developers can connect with the worldwide dev community and keep their domain and content ownership intact. This platform provides the perfect balance between not having to create everything from scratch and having full control over your work. It also helps you expand your reach and attract new followers who are eager to engage with your content.

Mostly I like the auto-saving feature while writing blogs on Hashnode.

Replit is the only coding platform that you can use anywhere. You can code from your mobile to your laptop or desktop and save it in the cloud. You create a folder called `repls` in the application using language-based templates and start coding in it which gets autosaved and runs anytime and anywhere for free.

The bounty feature is amazing which helps you to get started with freelancing while coding or learning a new tech stack. You can also collaborate with your teammates by inviting them and also push your code to GitHub directly.

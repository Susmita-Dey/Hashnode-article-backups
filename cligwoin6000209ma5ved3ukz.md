## Embracing the Best Technologies

ProManager's front end is built using Next.js, a robust React framework known for its server-side rendering capabilities. This ensures a smooth user experience and optimal performance, making ProManager highly user-friendly.

Our project utilizes the following tech stack:

* [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/): We've developed the complete frontend using Next.js, taking advantage of its powerful features.
    
* [**React.js**](https://react.dev/): We've incorporated React hooks and states, along with various packages, to enhance the functionality of the application.
    
* [**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/): We've employed Tailwind CSS for styling the entire application, providing a visually appealing and consistent design.
    
* [**Appwrite Cloud**](https://cloud.appwrite.io/): To power the backend and store user data, we rely on Appwrite Cloud services:
    
    * **Authentication**: Appwrite's Authentication feature allows users to sign up or log in to their ProManager accounts securely.
        
    * **Database**: We leverage the Appwrite Database service to store and manage user data associated with the various features of the application. There are a total of ***6 collections*** to manage the current features and services of ProManager.
        
    * **Storage**: Appwrite's Storage service enables users to upload and store images for different sections of the application, enhancing data management capabilities.
        
    * **Cloud Functions** - Node.js: We utilize Appwrite's Cloud Functions to enable users to delete their accounts with a simple button click, enhancing their control over their data.
        

For **seamless deploymen**t of our application, we rely on [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/), a robust platform that ensures the smooth hosting and management of our ProManager project.

Overall, this tech stack empowers us to create a feature-rich and reliable project management application that meets the needs of our users.

## Challenges We Faced

During the development of ProManager, our team encountered various challenges that tested our skills and problem-solving abilities. Here are some of the key challenges we faced and how we overcame them:

1. **Designing a User-Friendly Interface**: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface was crucial for ProManager. We had to strike the right balance between functionality and simplicity. Through continuous feedback and iterations, we were able to design a visually appealing and easy-to-use interface that enhances the overall user experience.
    
2. **Integration with Appwrite Services**: Leveraging the power of Appwrite services, such as Authentication, Database, Storage, and Cloud Functions, was essential for the functionality of ProManager. Integrating these services and ensuring smooth communication between the front-end and backend required careful planning and implementation. We faced some initial challenges in configuring the API calls and handling the data flow, but with thorough testing, debugging and the love from the **<mark>Appwrite community support</mark>** channel in Discord, we successfully integrated Appwrite into our application.
    
3. **Managing State and Data**: As ProManager involves multiple features and data interactions, managing the application state and handling data efficiently was a significant challenge. We adopted best practices in React and Next.js, utilized React hooks, and implemented proper data structuring techniques to ensure smooth data flow and synchronization between different components.
    
4. **Performance Optimization**: Building a highly performant application was crucial for delivering a seamless user experience. We faced challenges in optimizing the application's performance, including reducing network requests, optimizing image loading, and implementing code-splitting techniques. Through careful analysis and optimization, we were able to improve the application's speed and responsiveness.
    

Despite these challenges, our team remained determined and focused, continuously learning and adapting to overcome any obstacles that came our way. The experience taught us valuable lessons in learning new tech from documentation, problem-solving, and the importance of perseverance.

By addressing these challenges head-on, we were able to create a robust and user-friendly application that meets the needs of our users. The lessons learned from overcoming these challenges will undoubtedly benefit us in future projects as well.
